# Agent State Tracker

Both agents read and write this file. It is the single source of truth for progress.

**Rules:**
- Update YOUR section after completing each task
- Check the OTHER agent's section before starting a new task (for dependency resolution)
- On pairing tasks: check that the other agent is ready before proceeding
- If blocked, write the blocker here — the other agent checks this file at task boundaries
